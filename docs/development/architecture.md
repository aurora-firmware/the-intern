# Architecture

A high-level map of how The Intern fits together at runtime and which spec owns each part. It restates no
requirements: the specs and the accepted ADRs are the source of truth, and where this page differs from them, fix this
page. Read [S-000](../ai-team/specs/S-000-system-overview.md) for scope. The shared vocabulary and the spec map are in
[system_overview.html](../system_overview.html) (sections 4 and 5), and are not repeated here. The module rule comes
from the [coding guidelines](coding_guidelines.md).

## Runtime shape

The Intern is one daemon process (`bob serve`) that owns one pi-durable database, one SQLite file in the instance's
state directory ([S-002](../ai-team/specs/S-002-daemon-and-host-runtime.md), [ADR-001](../ai-team/decisions/ADR-001-one-daemon-process-owns-one-pi-durable-database.md)).
Nothing else reads or writes that file. The operating system's supervisor starts the daemon and restarts it after an
error exit, and unfinished work resumes from its checkpoints.

- **Service layer.** Every capability is a named read or control operation. Listeners, job sources and agent tools all
  call the same operations, and the layer knows nothing about transports, so adding a listener changes no operation
  (S-002).
- **Listeners.** Two listeners serve one HTTP protocol and belong to the Intern service
  ([S-003](../ai-team/specs/S-003-control-endpoint.md)). The local socket, `bob.sock` in the instance's runtime
  directory, is always on and serves the `bob` commands on the machine. The network listener is off until the
  configuration file has a `[network]` section; it then listens on the configured address and fixed port, in plain
  HTTP, and serves the web interface. Both expose every catalogue operation at `POST /operations/<name>`, with the
  routes derived from the catalogue so a new operation needs no listener change, and the observation feed as
  Server-Sent Events at `GET /feed`. Only the network listener serves the web interface files, under `/ui/`. No
  listener authenticates callers, checks request headers or encrypts traffic: whoever reaches a listener is a team
  member ([ADR-002](../ai-team/decisions/ADR-002-equal-team-members-bounded-by-the-service-account.md)). Each
  listener stamps the way in itself: it calls the service layer as a team member with the way in `command line` on
  the local socket and `web interface` on the network listener, and nothing in a request changes the caller (S-003
  REQ-007).
- **Client library.** The TypeScript library in `src/client/` calls operations and follows the feed through a
  listener, from Node over the local socket or a URL, or from a browser over a URL. The `bob` commands and the web
  interface reach the daemon only through it (S-003 REQ-009).
- **Job origin.** The service layer builds a job's origin from the caller, never from the input: a team member's job
  records a request with the caller's way in, an agent's job a follow-up of its conversation, and only a job source
  states its own origin (S-002 REQ-012, AC-012.5).
- **Observation feed.** The one source of live data for clients: a snapshot, then deltas. A client that is slow or
  gone never affects an agent run (S-002).
- **Worker threads.** A worker thread is a logical slot for one active agent run, not an operating-system thread. The
  count is fixed, and work beyond it waits in a stored arrival order (S-001, S-002, ADR-001).
- **Jobs and conversations.** Work is organised as jobs. Each job has one lead conversation whose current agent is
  the job's lead. Roles are the configuration agents are made from; a seat is a role's place in a conversation. The
  lead can hand its conversation to an agent of another role, or invoke agents of specialist roles in conversations of
  their own that report back (S-001).
- **Failure.** A storage error closes the harness; the daemon exits non-zero rather than reopening the database
  (S-002, ADR-001).

## Components and owning specs

The components are those of S-000, Components, Solution. This table gives the responsibility in one line and the spec
that defines it.

| Component | Responsibility | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| Intern service | The one long-running process: saved state, many jobs at once, resume after a restart, models, the shared operations, the feed, the listeners | S-002 (process, service layer, feed); S-003 (listeners, client library) |
| Agents and roles | Roles, seats, the lead and handoff, invoking specialist agents, monitoring of who works on what | S-001 |
| Jobs | The job record and the life of a job, blocked jobs and answers, history, export and import | No spec yet |
| Schedules and triggers | Starts jobs at set times and on events, with run history and on-demand runs | No spec yet |
| Email | The Intern's own mailbox as a way in and out | No spec yet |
| Web interface | The team's browser view and configuration, built only on service operations | No spec yet |
| Command line | The `bob` commands, built only on service operations | No spec yet |
| Skills and instructions | Shipped skills and instructions, and the team's overlay | No spec yet |
| Team knowledge | Reaching, reading and updating the wiki and other knowledge sources | No spec yet |

Development infrastructure components (S-000, Components, Development infrastructure) are not part of the runtime and
are not described here.

## Module rule

- **Pure core.** Decision logic imports neither pi-durable nor I/O and is tested without a harness.
- **pi-durable only behind the host.** Only the harness host module and the-intern's own pi-durable extensions import
  pi-durable. The service layer and every other component depend on the host's interface, so an upgrade of the pi
  packages touches a few files.
- **Every job source ends in the same service operation.** Every way in and job source submits through the service layer.
- **Listeners and the client library use only the service layer.** Listener and client library code imports neither
  the harness host nor any pi package. Listeners reach the daemon's state only through the catalogue, the feed and the
  lifecycle hooks, and import the daemon and feed modules only as types (S-003 REQ-013, ADR-001).
